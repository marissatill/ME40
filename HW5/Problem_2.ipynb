    "Let’s assume that you have a program/code/script do a multi-linear fit. It is a completely “black box”. The only thing you know is that it takes a series of input values x$_i$, y$_i$, z$_i$, one vector of output/target values t$_i$, and it returns the coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑 for a linear fit of the form 𝑡 = 𝑎x + 𝑏𝑦 + 𝑐𝑧 + 𝑑.\n",

    "This software outputs the same variables a, b, c, d, which in our case will be a = 𝛼, b = 𝛽, c = 𝛾, and d = 𝛿. The only thing we can change for this 'black box' program/code/script is the input.\n",

    "This method will perform a polynomial fit without changing the target output, simply expressing the polynomial as a linear combination of transformed input terms (multiplication of each term in the series)."
